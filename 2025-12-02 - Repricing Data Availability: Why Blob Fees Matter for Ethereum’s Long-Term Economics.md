Right now, at the time of this post, blobs are basically free to post (at just 1 wei) because there is no minimum cost attached to them.

Moving forward with the Fusaka upgrade, it plans to introduce a floor price via EIP-7918, but the real question is whether that change will be large enough to have an immediate and meaningful impact on ETH as an asset. In practice, the increase will be tiny at first. Even if the blob market were operating at full 8x capacity, the total annual burn would be around 500 ETH. In other words, the floor price will be a little more than a rounding error, maybe just a few dollars extra per blob in the early stages.

Considering the scale of Lighter's (a zero-knowledge rollup on top of Ethereum optimized for speed) annual revenue, estimated at roughly 300 million dollars, the case for Ethereum increasing its fees becomes quite straightforward. Yet many L2s appear committed to the idea of Ethereum alignment, primarily when that alignment comes at little to no cost. If Ethereum significantly increases data availability fees for Lighter, there is little to prevent it from migrating to an alternative DA provider.

And currently, this is the point of conflict. Ethereum needs to remain cheap enough for L2s to keep offering sub-cent fees, but it also needs blob pricing to matter for the protocol's health, and that balance is incredibly difficult to achieve.

Despite the current flawed pricing, the broader system still feels like it is working as intended. From the perspective of a lighter client or an L2, you get L1 security guarantees for very little money, simple interoperability with other rollups, and a familiar user experience. Ethereum provides L2s with a strong foundation; blob fees just need some fine-tuning, and that process is already underway.

Over time, as more L2s come online and blocks carry more blobs, the higher demand for blob space and fees should naturally scale into something far more significant for Ethereum’s economic model.
